title: "*K* parameter"

# Description

Here, a brief description of the estimation of K and the type of K plots is given. 
A detailed discussion on the meaning of K in SAP flow estimation can be found in [Nadezhdina, 2018] (https://doi.org/10.3832/ifor2381-011).

# Estimation
## Box: *K* estimation settings

*K* must be estimated for each thermometer position.
By clicking a radio button (**<1>**), *K* is estimated using the selected method (**<2>**) and optional filter options (**<3>**). 
If *K* is estimated correctly, it can be set using the 'Set *K*' button (**<4>**).

All set *K* values appear in the 'Selected' table (**<1>**).
The other tables (**<2>**) provide estimates for all thermometer positions at once, obtained with each method. 
All regression options (figure above **<3>**) apply to this table as well. 
If the values in these tables are sufficient, they can all be set at once by clicking "Use *K* estimates" below the table. 
If *K* values are provided in a csv file, the file can be uploaded in the 'Read csv' tab (**<2>**). 
Selected *K*s can also be exported as a data file (**<3>**).

For more information and recommendations on how to estimate *K*, see the Recommendations section.


## Box: Control plots

This box shows the typical *K* diagram (**<1>**) as well as two control diagrams (**<2>**) to assess the quality of the estimate.

It is possible to zoom in by defining the range of the x-axis variable by setting 'Scales' (**<3>**) to _fixed_ and defining minimum and maximum values.
If the 'regression' method is selected to estimate *K*, the regression line can be forced to cross the y-axis by enabling 'Fullrange regression' in the *K*-diagram 

The ‘Save figures’ button (**<5>**) downloads the *K*-diagram as well as the two control diagrams for the selected thermometer position.
