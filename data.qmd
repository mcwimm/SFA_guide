The ‘data’ menu item is divided in three subsections: upload, filter and view.

# Upload
## Box Upload file

To upload a csv file browse to the directory where the file is stored (**<1>**).
Select the input file type (**<2>**), the separator and the number of lines to skip (**<3>**).
If the upload is successful, the box `Preview data` shows a table with data.
To confirm the usage of the file click ‘Use data’ (**<4>**).
Afterwards, the file name is shown in the upper right corner of the SFA.
If the data is not shown correctly, open the csv-file externally and check the required column names (Table 1) and the csv-settings (i.e., comma delimited, tab delimited, etc.).
